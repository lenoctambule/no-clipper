# No Clipper

No Clipper is an **active** recon tool to quickly map an organizations network and services. 

## Import information

This material was prepared solely for informational purposes to clarify our intentions (by us, we mean all direct contributors to the project).

### **I. Non-responsability of software misuse**

This software is a simple banner grabbing tool made in an educational context. It's sole and only purpose is to help IT and Cybersecurity professionals do their job of reconnaissance.

Thus, we do cannot be held responsible for potential misusage by No Clipper users, precisely any purpose that stray away from it's intended use as stated above and any illegal activities refering to France's penal code definition of a cybercrime (article 323-1 and 323-7 of the french penal code).

In fact, the software is conceived to solely gather information that is already public and in the same philosophy as the web crawlers used by search engines. This software is not conceived to fraudulently access or maintain access to any information system and this can easily be verified through the open-source code of the software

### *II. Non-association with derived version of the software*

The software is open-source and has a copyleft license meaning that anyone can fork, use, modify the code as long as it complies with the license. It is then logical that we shall not be legally associated with the derivatives of No Clipper which may stray away from our original intents.
