# Noclipper : Open-source web-based reconnaisance and attack surface management set of tools (In developpment)

NoClipper is a toolbox for automating the reconnaissance phase of an engagement by scouring the internet for devices and services through targeted scans towards specific organisations or less efficient stochastic techniques, by scouring the internet for information coming from external sources and much more.

As of now, NoClipper is capable of :

- Discovering services throughout the internet through a spray-pray approach.
- HTTP Banner grabbing

Roadmap :

- [X] Stealth Scan
- [X] Banner grabber
- [ ] CIDR based scan
- [-] Subdomain enumeration through Google Dorking Impossible due to bot protections

The end goal is to create a modular tool capable of adapting to the constant evolution of the field of cybersecurity and help me find bounties alot faster.
